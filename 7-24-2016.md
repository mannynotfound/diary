I've been working pretty extensively on [twitter-hyperdrive](https://github.com/mannynotfound/twitter-hyperdrive) 
with the intent of using it as a renderer for an installation somewhere. Ideally it'll be able to render from
multiple sources too and not just twitter. 

Also I put out my first bumpers episode. bumpers is cool app some of my friends are working on that lets
you make mini-podcasts and easily share them. I think I was a little dull in it but it wasnt that bad, learned
some stuff for the next episode. It's about Paul Ford's "What is Code?" and you can listen to it [here](https://bumpers.fm/e/auaj86stoft000urpro0).
